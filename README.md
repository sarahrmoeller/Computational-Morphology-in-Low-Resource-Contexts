This is my second qualifying paper in the PhD progress at University of Colorado Boulder Dept. of Linguitics and Institute in Cognitive Science. Hopefully, it be a big chunk of my dissertation's lit review. The last section is serving as an unofficial proposal to the dissertation proposal.

Readable is the PDF version.
